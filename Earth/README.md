**3D Earth Visualization using Three.js**
Project Overview
This project is a 3D Earth visualization built using Three.js, a popular 3D rendering library in JavaScript. The Earth is rendered with day and night textures, cloud layers, and a glowing atmosphere. Users can interact with the Earth using OrbitControls, allowing them to rotate and zoom into the globe. Additionally, a starfield surrounds the Earth, giving it a space-like environment.
